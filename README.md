## Installing Styleguide
Make sure you are running [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v0.10.42/) to run npm and grunt commands

### NPM

The styleguide is an NPM module.  It also has dependencies on other NPM modules.  We now store these and other modules in an NPM repository on Artifactory.  Artifactory also acts as a proxy for other dependencies normally found on the Internet.  By using Artifactory hosted on KP network, the installation should be much quicker for these modules.  To use the repository, you must update your local ~/.npmrc file.  Do this by running the following command in a terminal:

    cat > ~/.npmrc <<- EOM
    registry= https://artifactory-fof.appl.kp.org/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual
    always-auth=false
    EOM

You can now install styleguide by running the following command in your project directory: (note that the version could change with future updates)

    npm install -D http://artifactory-fof.appl.kp.org/artifactory/npm-release/styleguide/-/styleguide-0.0.1.tgz

### Viewing the repository locally

* In Terminal/cmd  (if you cloned or forked the project) run npm` you@host:~ stylguide$ npm install`
* Then `you@host:~ stylguide$grunt serve`
* Open any browser type in your local host with port example: `localhost:4321`

## How to Use Styleguide in your Projects
### Modern Styles with Webpack

If you're using [build-plugin](https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/build-plugin/browse) you'll be using webpack
If you are using modern styles and using webpack then import the following sass file:

    @import "~styleguide/modern-webpack";

Note: Legacy has been deprecated.

Reference this example [kp-header-component](https://stash.kp.org/projects/CDS/repos/kp-header-component/browse)

### Not on webpack or using our build-plugin

    // modern
    @import "styleguide/modern";

The node_modules directory will have to be in your SCSS build path. This is particularly important if you're not using [build-plugin](https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/build-plugin/browse).

You can view the list of SCSS styles in the repo: [Styleguide lib]:(https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/styleguide/browse/lib/modern/stylesheets)

### Bower (deprecated)

Include this styleguide repo in your `bower.json`

    "dependencies": {
      "..." : "...",
      "styleguide": "git+ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git"
    }

Then run `bower install` - watch all the front-end stuff bower installs. You should see something similar to the following in your output:

    bower styleguide#*  not-cached ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#*
    bower styleguide#*  resolve ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#*
    bower styleguide#*  checkout master
    bower styleguide#*  resolved ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#19b64a1850

### Gulp

Still figuring this out. You will experience import SASS errors when you import styleguide on a gulp project.

<a name="commands"></a>
## Commands to Develop and Contribute to Styleguide
The styleguide has moved over to use NPM scripts to make building, serving and linting the project easier for new contributors. There are currently three commands that can be run but more can be added to the package.json as needed.

### Linting the Project
  This command will lint the scss files in lib/modern.

    npm run lint

### Building the Project
  This command will lint and build the project.

    npm run build

### Serving the Project
  This command will lint and serve the project on port :4321.

    npm start

## What's in Styleguide
There is a lot that Styleguide comes with and does a lot so that you don't have to. Bootstrap and Bourbon are installed via Styleguide so your local projects need not include boostrap and bourbon.

### Bourbon / Neat

We're using [bourbon.io](http://bourbon.io/). It's not a framework like Bootstrap. Instead, it's a library of _Mixins_ that allow one to have more control over styles. It's minimalistic in nature, but offers additional features through [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) which is a Bourbon add-on that offers grids and layout helpers.

<a name="namespacing"></a>
## Namespacing your app
It is very important to name space your styles for your APP. This will avoid conflict of your app integrating into AEM. Example, in your main.scss

        #my-awesome-app {
          // include styleguide and what else
          .button{...}
          ...
          //all the styles fall in here
        }
