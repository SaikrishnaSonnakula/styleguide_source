## Installing Styleguide
Make sure you are running [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v0.10.42/) to run npm and grunt commands

### NPM

The styleguide is NPM module.  You can install it by running the following command in your project directory:

    npm install -D git+ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git

### Viewing the repository locally

* In Terminal/cmd  (if you cloned or forked the project) run npm` you@host:~ stylguide$ npm install`
* Then `you@host:~ stylguide$grunt serve`
* Open any browser type in your local host with port example: `localhost:4321`

## How to Use Styleguide in your Projects
### Modern Styles with Webpack

If you're using [build-plugin](https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/build-plugin/browse) you'll be using webpack
If you are using modern styles and using webpack then import the following sass file:

    @import "~styleguide/modern-webpack";

Note: Legacy has been deprecated.

Reference this example [kp-header-component](https://stash.kp.org/projects/CDS/repos/kp-header-component/browse)

### Not on webpack or using our build-plugin

    // modern
    @import "styleguide/modern";

The node_modules directory will have to be in your SCSS build path. This is particularly important if you're not using [build-plugin](https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/build-plugin/browse).

You can view the list of SCSS styles in the repo: [Styleguide lib]:(https://stash.kp.org/projects/RWD/repos/styleguide/browse/lib/modern/stylesheets)

### Bower (deprecated)

Include this styleguide repo in your `bower.json`

    "dependencies": {
      "..." : "...",
      "styleguide": "git+ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git"
    }

Then run `bower install` - watch all the front-end stuff bower installs. You should see something similar to the following in your output:

    bower styleguide#*  not-cached ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#*
    bower styleguide#*  resolve ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#*
    bower styleguide#*  checkout master
    bower styleguide#*  resolved ssh://git@stash.kp.org/rwd/styleguide.git#19b64a1850

### Gulp

Still figuring this out. You will experience import SASS errors when you import styleguide on a gulp project.

## What's in Styleguide
There is a lot that Styleguide comes with and does a lot so that you don't have to. Bootstrap and Bourbon are installed via Styleguide so your local projects need not include boostrap and bourbon.

### Bourbon / Neat

We're using [bourbon.io](http://bourbon.io/). It's not a framework like Bootstrap. Instead, it's a library of _Mixins_ that allow one to have more control over styles. It's minimalistic in nature, but offers additional features through [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) which is a Bourbon add-on that offers grids and layout helpers.

<a name="namespacing"></a>
## Namespacing your app
It is very important to name space your styles for your APP. This will avoid conflict of your app integrating into AEM. Example, in your main.scss

        #my-awesome-app {
          // include styleguide and what else
          .button{...}
          ...
          //all the styles fall in here
        }
