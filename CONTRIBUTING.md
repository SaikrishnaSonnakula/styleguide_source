## Raising Issues

Did you find a bug, defect, typo? Help us by bringing it up in Hipchat and check to see if it has been identified in our [roadmap]().
If you have a proposed solution, let us know by [submitting a pull-request](#pull-requests).

## Writing Documentation

If you think there's a better way to explain the process of contributing to Styleguide, please let us know and help us write. You don't even have to be too technical on this one. =)

## Submitting Pull Requests for new Features and Bug Fixes

If you have a new feature you'd like to merge into Styleguide please consult a UX designer like Jennifer Beasely or Bob Altman to get their thumbs up on having your work shared across projects that use Styleguide.

Pull requests are **awesome**. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#raising-issues) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. 
This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged.
To make sure your PR is accepted as quickly as possible, please take a minute to check the guidelines on:

* [commit messages]()
* [cleaning-up history]()
* [not breaking the build]()

### Testing and Quality Assurance

#### Checking out a Pull Request

Read this blog post for [detailed instructions](http://dev.ghost.org/easy-git-pr-test/) on configuring your environment to allow you to checkout pull requests with this simple command: `pr #1234`
In terms of Stash configuration the second ```fetch``` line mentioned in the post would be 
```
fetch = +refs/pull-requests/*/from:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*
```
