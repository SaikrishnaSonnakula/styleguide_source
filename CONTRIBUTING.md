You can ask questions about Styleguide and what you need to get it up and running as well as how best to Fork and get your contribution approved.

##Ways you are contributing to...
- Raising issues - bugs, defects, typos or just bad grammer. You can help us correct this.
- New features - you've worked on something in your own project at KP, and you think it would be useful for other projects you can added at feature. But please remember to consult with a UX person like Jennifer Beasely or Bob Altman to get their head-nod. They would most likely have an idea that your feature maybe used in other parts of KP development.
- Writing documentation - if you think there's a better way to explain the process please let us know and you can help us write. You don't even have to be too technical on this one. =)
