# Contributing to Styleguide

Welcome to contributing! We welcome all in the KP developer community contribute to styleguide. Please contact us via hipchat room "Styleguide Core" if you haven't already. You can ask questions about Styleguide and what you need to get it up and running as well as how best to Fork and get your contribution approved.

##Ways you are contributing to...
- Raising issues - bugs, defects, typos or just bad grammer. You can help us correct this.
- New features - you've worked on something in your own project at KP, and you think it would be useful for other projects you can added at feature. But please remember to consult with a UX person like Jennifer Beasely or Bob Altman to get their head-nod. They would most likely have an idea that your feature maybe used in other parts of KP development.
- Writing documentation - if you think there's a better way to explain the process please let us know and you can help us write. You don't even have to be too technical on this one. =)

##Submitting Pull Requests

## Submitting Pull Requests for new Features and Bug Fixes

If you have a new feature you'd like to merge into Styleguide please consult a UX designer like Jennifer Beasely or Bob Altman to get their thumbs up on having your work shared across projects that use Styleguide.

Pull requests are **awesome**. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#raising-issues) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. 
This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged.
To make sure your PR is accepted as quickly as possible, please take a minute to check the guidelines on:

* [commit messages]()
* [cleaning-up history]()
* [not breaking the build]()

### Testing and Quality Assurance

#### Checking out a Pull Request

Read this blog post for [detailed instructions](http://dev.ghost.org/easy-git-pr-test/) on configuring your environment to allow you to checkout pull requests with this simple command: `pr #1234`
In terms of Stash configuration the second ```fetch``` line mentioned in the post would be 
```
fetch = +refs/pull-requests/*/from:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*
```
